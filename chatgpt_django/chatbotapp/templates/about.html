                <p style="font-size:20px">A chatbot is a computer program that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to simulate human-like conversations.  
                    It can communicate with users through text or voice, and is commonly used in websites, apps, and messaging platforms.  
                    Chatbots can answer questions, provide information, help with tasks, and even have friendly conversations â€” all in real-time, 24/7.  
                    They're designed to make user interaction easier, faster, and more engaging, just like chatting with a real person!</p>
